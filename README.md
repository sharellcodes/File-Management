# File-Organization

### Context
I constantly create files to practice various programming skills. I tend to recreate the same files, and I
also tend to add the files to folders that I forget about, with names that I forget about. This will 
help me to be intentional about my naming conventions and stay organized.

### Goals
1. Whenever I create a new [Java, C++, HTML, CSS, Javscript, Swift, Python] file, I want the 
   boilerplate code.
2. I create a lot of practice files for specific subjects. I want the files to automatically be moved to.
   the appropriate folder, no matter where I create it
   1. I want to have the file created in a specific folder based on the name of the file at creation time.
   2. I want to have an automated process that monitors the home directory for any files that I happen to create outside of the desired folders.
